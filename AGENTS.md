# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repo.

## What this is

Hero Slate renders simple Dungeons & Dragons character sheets from hand-edited
YAML, as a static web app with no backend. It exists to invert a reference-heavy
sheet: show **who you are and what you have** — stats, hit points, trackers, short
prompts — so a 9-year-old describes what she wants to do instead of reading a menu
of legal moves. The product intent lives in `openspec/prd.md`; the release plan and
milestone status live in `openspec/discovery.md`.

## Durable constraints (honor in every change)

## Toolchain

## Workflow

- Planning uses **OpenSpec**: in-flight work lives under `openspec/changes/`;
  durable specs under `openspec/specs/`; decision records under `docs/decisions/`. Use
  the `opsx:*` skills (propose → apply → verify → archive).

### OpenSpec git workflow

One branch and one pull request carry a change through its whole lifecycle —
propose, apply, verify, archive — and merge once. There is no "cross `main`
between phases" step.

- **Branch per change.** One OpenSpec change (one discovery story) = one branch =
  one PR. Dependent stories **stack**: branch off the parent's branch and target
  its PR; independent stories branch off `main`.
- **A commit per unit of work.** Each artifact (proposal, design, specs, tasks) is
  its own `docs:` commit; each implementation task is its own commit with its real
  type (`feat:`/`fix:`/`refactor:`/`test:`); the archive is its own `chore:` commit.
- **Draft until archived.** Open the PR as a draft at propose. Run propose → apply →
  verify → archive all on the branch; `archive` moves the change to
  `openspec/changes/archive/` and syncs delta specs into `openspec/specs/`. Flip the
  PR to ready when the archive commit lands.
- **User owns the merge.** The agent never merges a PR unless explicitly asks and 
  confirmed. Stacks merge bottom-up: parent to `main` first, then retarget and merge 
  each child.
- **If a ready PR gets change-requests,** flip it back to draft and `git revert` the
  archive commit — this restores the change under `openspec/changes/` and unwinds the
  spec sync. Make the fixes, re-archive as the last commit, and flip ready again. A
  rejected PR is just closed and its branch deleted; `main` stays clean.
- **Issue provenance.** When a change originates from a GitHub issue, discovery
  records `Origin: #<issue>` on the story and propose carries it into `proposal.md`.
  A PR that fully resolves a single issue says `Closes #<issue>`; a PR that is one of
  many stories under an epic or milestone issue says `Part of #<issue>`, and that
  parent issue is closed only once `discovery.md` shows all its stories archived.

## Writing document artifacts — plain language

Write every document artifact — READMEs, ADRs, GitHub issue bodies/designs, `docs/`,
PR descriptions, and other prose deliverables — to the **ISO 24495 Plain Language**
standard: reader-first, purposeful structure, findable, understandable, and
actionable. Apply the core standard (`iso-24495-1`) to all prose, and the
science/technical sector standard (`iso-24495-3`) to architecture specs, design docs,
and software documentation. This governs prose only — code, config, and test fixtures
follow the toolchain's own conventions.

## Scratch & Working Files

Temporary files — scratch notes, intermediate output, working scripts, throwaway data — go in
**`.workspace/`** at the repo root. It is gitignored (see `.gitignore`). **Use it instead of `/tmp`
or any scratchpad path your tooling suggests** — this convention overrides a harness-provided
scratchpad location. Create the directory if it isn't there (`mkdir -p .workspace`). Nothing durable
lives here; anything worth keeping belongs in the repo tree or a GitHub issue.
